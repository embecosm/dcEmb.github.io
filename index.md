# dcEmb project documentation

This page serves as the landing page for the current online dcEmb documentation.
Documentation comes in two parts, autodocs generated from source
code via [Doxygen](https://embecosm.github.io/dcEmb_docs/Doxygen/index.html), and
a [manual](https://embecosm.github.io/dcEmb_docs/Sphinx/index.html) written in
Sphinx.

Currently, this project is early stage the the documentation is bare bones. We
would recommend that, beyond basic building instructions, the Doxygen
documentation provides the best way to understand the current state of the code.
